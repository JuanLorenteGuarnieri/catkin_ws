# Laboratory 3
Before starting **important**:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```
It is good practice to run at startup even if it is not used directly:
```bash
roscore
```

## Start
Check that everything is working
```bash
catkin_make
roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo quadrotor_empty_world.launch
```
This command opens gazebo11 where you can view the drone.

## Exercise 1

**Include the package in your workspace and compile it using catkin build. To execute it, run roscore in one tab of the terminal. Run an instance of rviz in a second tab**

```bash
rosrun rviz rviz
```
Open the visualization configuration `File -> Open Config -> arob6.rviz`
```bash
rosrun lab3_drones drone_race _targets_file_path:=/home/arob/catkin_ws/src/p14_arob_lab3_drones/data/gates.txt

```
As a result we see the following image:

## Exercise 2

**Open the file drone_race.cpp and localize the function drawGateMarkers. Observe how to specify in the code the properties of the markers and understand how the gate is created. Change the left corners of the gate to make them yellow spheres with a radius of 25 centimeters**

`p14_arob_lab3_drones/src/drone_race.cpp`

In the drawGateMarkers_ function, each gate is created by defining multiple Marker objects that represent the corners and edges of the gate. 
Each marker is given specific properties, such as shape, color, and position.

```c++
//Sphere
marker.type = visualization_msgs::Marker::SPHERE;

// Make yellow corners
marker.color.r = 1.0;
marker.color.g = 1.0;

//Radius
marker.scale.x = 0.25;
marker.scale.y = 0.25;
marker.scale.z = 0.25;

```

As a result we see the following image:

## Exercise 3

**Toggle on the topics trajectory_vectors and trajectory_markers in rviz. Run again the drone_race node and observe the trajectory computed in the example. Observe how the trajectory changes if you comment the velocity constraint of the middle vertex. Observe also how the acceleration changes if you reduce the segment times.**

**Now you are ready to dive into the function generate_trajectory, which contains part of the necessary code to compute a trajectory given the list of gates**



## Exercise 4
**Complete all the necessary code to make Hector follow a trajectory that goes through all the gates. Hector must start and end the race at the origin of coordinates. Your solution has to work with the two race tracks that we provide (gates.txt and gates_hard.txt).**

The starting position is set to the origin (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).

For each gate in gates_, an intermediate Vertex is added to represent the waypoint at that gate’s position.
The position of each gate is added as a constraint to ensure that the trajectory passes through each gate.
Each gate’s orientation is used to calculate a direction vector perpendicular to the gate. A velocity constraint is added along this direction with a desired magnitude, ensuring that the drone approaches each gate at a controlled speed and in the correct direction.

After passing through all the gates, the drone returns to the origin as the final point.

we compute the estimated time required for each segment between the vertices. This considers constraints on maximum velocity and maximum acceleration

```c++
void DroneRace::generateTrajectory_() {
    const int dimension = 3; // x, y, z
    const int derivative_to_optimize = mav_trajectory_generation::derivative_order::SNAP; // Minimize snap for smooth flight
