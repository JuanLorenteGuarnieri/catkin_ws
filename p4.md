# Laboratory 3
Before starting **important**:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```
It is good practice to run at startup even if it is not used directly:
```bash
roscore
```

## Start

## Exercise 1
**You need to go to the parent directory of the package "p14_arob_lab4" and execute:**
`find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/p14/p??/g' {} +`

**Build the package and run the launch file arob-p4-navigation-basic.launch file. Notice that the first line of this file sets the parameter `use_sim_time` to true. This is to make sure all nodes running in our system use the simulation time published in the `/clock` topic by Stage simulator.**

```bash
roslaunch  p14_arob_lab4 arob-p4-navigation-basic.launch
```

**In another terminal publish a message in the topic /move_base_simple/goal and see how the robot moves to the goal:**

```bash
`rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{ header: { frame_id: "map" }, pose: { position: { x: -3, y: 0 }, orientation: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, w: 1 } } }'`
```

## Exercise 2

**Close everything and launch the file arob-p4-navigation-rviz.launch that includes an instance of rviz. Observe the value of the different topics sending different goals to the robot.**

```bash
rosrun rviz rviz
```

Open configuration in rviz: `p14_arob_lab4/config`

## Exercise 3

**Now you have all the tools to analyze how some parameters can affect robot navigation. In particular, modify the value of the following parameters in the launch and configuration files:**
**- Try different global and local planners (planner_selection.yaml)**

```yaml
base_local_planner: base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS
base_global_planner: carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner
```

- Number of particles in AMCL
`p14_arob_lab4/launch/arob-p4-navigation-basic.launch`
```xml
    <param name="min_particles"             value="500"/>
	<param name="max_particles"             value="2000"/>
```

- Add obstacles:
`p14_arob_lab4/world/simple.world`


- Use the dynamic obstacle to make it difficult for the robot!**
```
block( pose [ 4 4 0 0 ] name "dynamic_obstacle_1" color "red" motion "sine" period 2 amplitude 2 )
block( pose [ 2 2 0 0 ] name "dynamic_obstacle_2" color "yellow" motion "linear" velocity [0.5 -0.5 0] )

```

``` bash
rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core
```

```

## Exercise 5

**Complete functions computeVelocityCommands() and isGoalReached() in llc_local_planner.cpp file to implement your low level controller. Do not forget to include the parameter values for your low level controller, which are defined in llc_local_planner_params.yaml.**

Modified `p14_arob_lab4/src/llc_local_planner.cpp`

```c++
bool LLCLocalPlanner::computeVelocityCommands(geometry_msgs::Twist& cmd_vel) {
		std::cout << "ComputeVelocityCommands ..." << std::endl;

		if (!initialized_) {
			ROS_ERROR("The planner has not been initialized.");
			return false;
		}

		// Get robot and goal pose in the global frame of the local costmap
		geometry_msgs::PoseStamped robot_pose;
		costmap_ros_->getRobotPose(robot_pose);
		geometry_msgs::PoseStamped goal = global_plan_.back();

		//Read obstacle information from the costmap
		costmap_ = costmap_ros_->getCostmap();
		for (unsigned int i=0; i<costmap_->getSizeInCellsX()-1; i++){
			for (unsigned int j=0; j<costmap_->getSizeInCellsY()-1; j++){
				if (costmap_->getCost(i,j) == costmap_2d::LETHAL_OBSTACLE){
					double obs_wx, obs_wy;
					geometry_msgs::Pose obs_pose;					
					costmap_->mapToWorld(i, j, obs_pose.position.x, obs_pose.position.y); //mapToWorld returns coordinates in the global frame of the local costmap
					// std::cout << "Obs coordinates: " << obs_pose.position.x << ", " << obs_pose.position.y << std::endl;
					
					if (euclideanDistance(robot_pose.pose, obs_pose) < 1.5*robot_radius_){
						ROS_ERROR("Imminent collision");
						return false;
					}
				}
			}
		}

		// Calculate polar coordinates (rho, alpha, beta)
		double dx = goal.pose.position.x - robot_pose.pose.position.x;
		double dy = goal.pose.position.y - robot_pose.pose.position.y;
		double rho = euclideanDistance(goal.pose, robot_pose.pose);
		double theta = tf::getYaw(robot_pose.pose.orientation);
		double alpha = angles::normalize_angle(atan2(dy, dx) - theta);
		double beta = angles::normalize_angle(-theta - alpha);

		// Compute control law for linear and angular velocities
		cmd_vel.linear.x = krho_ * rho; // Linear velocity
		cmd_vel.angular.z = kalpha_ * alpha + kbeta_ * beta; // Angular velocity

		if (krho_ <= 0 || kbeta_ >= 0 || (kalpha_ - krho_ <= 0))
		{
			cmd_vel.linear.x = 0.0;
			cmd_vel.angular.z = 0.0;
		}

		// Debug information
		ROS_INFO("Robot position: (%f, %f), Goal position: (%f, %f)", 
				robot_pose.pose.position.x, robot_pose.pose.position.y, 
				goal.pose.position.x, goal.pose.position.y);
		ROS_INFO("Rho: %f, Alpha: %f, Beta: %f", rho, alpha, beta);
		ROS_INFO("Linear Velocity: %f, Angular Velocity: %f", cmd_vel.linear.x, cmd_vel.angular.z);

		return true;
	}

```
It's part of a low-level local planner in the ROS navigation stack, responsible for calculating velocity commands

1. The function begins by checking if the planner has been properly initialized. 
2. Obtain current pose of the robot from the local costmap and goal pose (last pose in the global plan) 
3. Converts map coordinates of obstacles into world coordinates. Checks the Euclidean distance between the robot and detected obstacles. If an obstacle is too close, it logs an imminent collision error and halts execution.
4. Polar Coordinate Transformation:

- `rho`: Distance to the goal.
- `alpha`: Bearing angle between the robot's orientation and the goal direction.
- `beta`: Relative orientation angle, considering the goal and the robot's current heading.

5. Control Law for Velocities. Calculare angular and linear velocities
- `v = krho_ * rho`
- `w = kalpha_ * alpha + kbeta_ * beta`
- `rho_ <= 0 || kbeta_ >= 0 || (kalpha_ - krho_ <= 0`: Check de parameters

6. Command Publishing. 



```c++
bool LLCLocalPlanner::isGoalReached() {
		std::cout << "isGoalReached ..." << std::endl;

		if (!initialized_) {
			ROS_ERROR("This planner has not been initialized.");
			return false;
		}

		// Get robot and goal pose in the global frame of the local costmap
		geometry_msgs::PoseStamped robot_pose;
		costmap_ros_->getRobotPose(robot_pose);
		const geometry_msgs::PoseStamped& goal = global_plan_.back();

		// Calculate distance and orientation difference
		double dx = goal.pose.position.x - robot_pose.pose.position.x;
		double dy = goal.pose.position.y - robot_pose.pose.position.y;
		double rho = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

		double theta_robot = tf::getYaw(robot_pose.pose.orientation);
		double theta_goal = tf::getYaw(goal.pose.orientation);
		double orientation_diff = fabs(angles::normalize_angle(theta_goal - theta_robot));

		// Check if both position and orientation are within thresholds
		if (rho < rho_th_ && orientation_diff < 0.1) {
			ROS_INFO("Goal reached successfully.");
			return true;
		}

		return false;
	}

```

Determines whether the robot has reached its goal position and orientation.
checks if the robot has reached its goal by evaluating:

- Proximity: The robot is within a certain distance `rho_th_` of the goal position.
- Orientation Alignment: The robot's orientation is sufficiently aligned with the goal orientation

1. The function first verifies if the planner has been properly initialized.

2. Obtain current pose of the robot from the local costmap and goal pose (last pose in the global plan) 

3. Computes the Euclidean distance between the robot and the goal `rho = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);`
Calculates the difference in orientation between the robot's heading `theta_robot` and the goal orientation `theta_goal`.
`orientation_diff = fabs(angles::normalize_angle(theta_goal - theta_robot))`

4. Check Thresholds
- verifes the distance to the goal is less than the distance threshold 
- The orientation difference is less than 0.1 radians

5. If both conditions are satisfied, the goal is considered reached.
