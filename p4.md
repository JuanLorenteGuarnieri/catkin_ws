# Laboratory 3
Before starting **important**:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```
It is good practice to run at startup even if it is not used directly:
```bash
roscore
```

## Start

## Exercise 1
**You need to go to the parent directory of the package “pXX_arob_lab4” and execute:**
`find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/p14/p??/g' {} +`

**Build the package and run the launch file arob-p4-navigation-basic.launch file. Notice that the first line of this file sets the parameter `use_sim_time` to true. This is to make sure all nodes running in our system use the simulation time published in the `/clock` topic by Stage simulator.**

**In another terminal publish a message in the topic /move_base_simple/goal and see how the robot moves to the goal:**

`rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{ header: { frame_id: "map" }, pose: { position: { x: -3, y: 0 }, orientation: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, w:1 } } }'`

## Exercise 2

**Close everything and launch the file arob-p4-navigation-rviz.launch that includes an instance of rviz. Observe the value of the different topics sending different goals to the robot.**


## Exercise 3

**Now you have all the tools to analyze how some parameters can affect robot navigation. In particular, modify the value of the following parameters in the launch and configuration files:**
- Try different global and local planners (planner_selection.yaml)
- Number of particles in AMCL
- Use the dynamic obstacle to make it difficult for the robot!**


## Exercise 4

## Exercise 5

**Complete functions computeVelocityCommands() and isGoalReached() in llc_local_planner.cpp file to implement your low level controller. Do not forget to include the parameter values for your low level controller, which are defined in llc_local_planner_params.yaml.**

## Exercise 6

**Launch file arob-p4-navigation-plugin.launch with llc_local_planner as the local planner (planner_selection.yaml), and send different goals to evaluate the robot behavior.**

## Exercise 7

**The following exercise consists of testing the code implemented in the previous exercise on a real platform. To do this, you should send the package "pXX_arob_lab4" to one of the robots available for real-world testing. The code will be loaded using the method indicated during the practical session.**
