### Course Goals

The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of autonomous mobile robots. Students will:
- Develop a software stack for an autonomous mobile robot.
- Analyze mathematical models and practical aspects of robotics.
- Explore research-oriented solutions with a scientific perspective.
- Gain familiarity with handling relevant research papers and literature.

### Syllabus

- **Spatial transformations**: Work with 3D coordinates, homogeneous coordinates, and reference systems.
- **Low-level control**: Model robot behavior using differential equations and control basic motion.
- **Motion planning**: Study algorithms to determine optimal paths in different environments.
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: Combine high- and low-level control for trajectory tracking.
- **Probabilistic localization and sensor fusion**: Learn to localize the robot and manage uncertainties.
- **Reinforcement learning**: Explore ongoing research in robotics and learning algorithms.
