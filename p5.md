# Laboratory 5
Before starting **important**:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```
It is good practice to run at startup even if it is not used directly:
```bash
roscore
```

## Start

## Exercise 1
Terminal 1:
```bash
roscore
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
rosrun roscpp_tutorials add_two_ints_server
```

Terminal 3:
```bash
rosservice list
```
```bash
/add_two_ints
/add_two_ints_server/get_loggers
/add_two_ints_server/set_logger_level
/rosout/get_loggers
/rosout/set_logger_level
```

To see the type of service
```bash
rosservice type /add_two_ints
```
`roscpp_tutorials/TwoInts`

To see the service definition
```bash
rossrv show roscpp_tutorials/TwoInts
```
```
int64 a
int64 b
---
int64 sum
```

## Exercise 2

**Complete the implementation of the RRT algorithm in file rrt_global_planner.cpp such that, when sending a goal through RViz or publishing a message on the topic /move_base_simple/goal, a path is computed and followed by the robot. Remember that this global planner should be registered as a plugin in ROS to be used in move_base. You can test the implementation with:**

To test the implemetation
```bash
roslaunch  arob_lab5 arob-p5-navigation.launch

rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{header: {stamp: now, frame_id: "map"}, pose: {position: {x: -3, y: 0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1}}}'

rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{header: {stamp: now, frame_id: "map"}, pose: {position: {x: 5, y: 5, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1}}}'

```

## Exercise 3

**Test again the system using also the plugin of your low level controller (implemented in lab4) as the local planner in move_base.**
